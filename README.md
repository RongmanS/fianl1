# Life Expectancy and Fertility Visualization (1964-2013)

## Overview
This project visualizes the relationship between life expectancy and fertility across 244 countries from 1964 to 2013.  
It is an interactive Bokeh visualization where:
- X-axis: Fertility   
- Y-axis: Life expectancy
- Point size represents population  
- Color represents region  

## Features
- Interactive slider to select the year  
- Hover tool displays country, year, life expectancy, fertility, and population  
- Clickable legend to hide/show regions  

## Data
- Source: Gapminder.org  
- File: `gapminder.csv`  

## Files
- `life_expectancy_fertility.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code and visualization  
- `gapminder.csv` → Dataset  
- `project_description.md` → Research question, methods, data explanation  
- `process_book.md` → Daily learning and development notes  

## How to Run
1. Install Python packages: `pandas`, `bokeh`  
2. Open `final1
3. ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
4. Run all cells to generate the interactive plot  
5. The plot can be saved as HTML using `output_file()`
